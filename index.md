#### Welcome to my little website.

I'm an PhD student in computer science at the Missouri University of
Science and Technology in Rolla, MO. It's a good time.

When I'm not busy with school stuff, I like building Django web
applications and learning new programming languages. I've been a
developer for Missouri S&T ACM SIG-Game since Fall 2009. Check out our
awesome framework at [siggame.github.com](siggame.github.com).

Sometimes I doodle. That's also a fun time.
